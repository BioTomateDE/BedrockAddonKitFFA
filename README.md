> [!NOTE]
This project was made a long time ago (1 year lol) and is not 
representative of my current programming/organization skills.

## How to use
Don't.
These scripts requires specific world coordinates to set up correctly.
Also, the code is not documented very well.

However, if there is literally a single person interested in using this,
please open an issue and I will gladly make this usable for others.
